‚ö° His son with the same name did. Sometimes there are errors where two people with the same name and address will be registered incorrectly, this is obviously exceedingly rare.

### ü§î About 6,000 votes for Trump in Antrim county Michigan were swapped to Biden votes by a software glitch?
‚ö°  The 6000 vote swap was only for data the software produced for unofficial results, and this error only occurs when the software wasn't updated to the latest version. Even on outdated versions a seperate tabulation is stored by the software for internal official use and this version did not swap the votes.

### ü§î Republican poll watchers were barred from entering a Detroit ballot count?
‚ö°  Both Republican and Democratic poll watchers were barred from entering. There was a 134 person maximum for poll watchers for the building, and accidentally over 200 per party were let in. When some left the building for a break or food they were not allowed back in due to the over-max counts.

### ü§î A Republican poll watcher was not allowed to watch in Philedelphia?
‚ö°  An attorney for the Trump campaign argued that one campaign observer was not allowed in saying he was left to ‚Äútwiddle his thumbs‚Äù before it became clear he would not be allowed in.

The judge wanted to know if the Trump campaign was allowed in the room even if one particular person wasn‚Äôt. Trump‚Äôs attorney waffled and the judge pressed him, ‚ÄúI am asking you as a member of the bar of this court are people representing  the Donald J. Trump for President in that room?‚Äù

Marcus replied, ‚Äúyes."
