### 🤔 About 6,000 votes for Trump in Antrim county Michigan were swapped to Biden voted by a software glitch.
⚡  The 6000 vote swap was only for data the software produced for unofficial results, and this error only occurs when the software wasn't updated to the latest version. Even on outdated versions a seperate tabulation is stored by the software for internal official use and this version did not swap the votes.
